# üçî Delish List

<!-- See the deployed version here -->

## Description

For my portfolio project during my full-stack javascript I built an app that allows users to create wish lists of restaurants they want to try. Users can share wish lists with friends and there can be multiple collaborators on a list. The front-end is created with JavaScript, React, Redux and CSS, and the back-end with an Express server, JWT & Bcrypt authentication and a PostgreSQL database with Sequelize ORM. I fetched restaurant data from Google Places API and rendered a map for each restaurant's location.

I started with brainstorming and creating a database diagram, wireframes, and user stories followed by setting up the back end and working through each feature. I was able to apply many new concepts including many to many relations, using maps, and further my skills with React Redux.

## User Stories

As a user:

- I'm interested in visiting new restaurants, everytime I hear of a good restaurant to try, I want to keep it on a list so that I can refer back to it when I‚Äôm in the mood to go out to eat.
- I want to be able to see a specific list and add restaurants to it.
- I want to be able to view the restaurant‚Äôs details, location, and website.
- Once I visit the restaurant, I want to be able to mark it as visited. If I enjoyed it, I want to mark it as a favorite and save it for future reference.
- My friends and I like to dine together, I want to be able to create a shared wish list where we can all collaborate and add our restaraunt ideas to the list.
- If I need inspiration, I want to be able to browse a list of restaurants and have the option to view more details, add them to one of my lists, or add them as a favorite.
